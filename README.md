# Developing ASP.NET 5 Applications

ASP.NET 5 is a new open-source ([github.com/aspnet/home](https://github.com/aspnet/home)) and cross-platform framework for building modern cloud-based Web applications using .NET. It is being built from the ground up to provide an optimized development framework for apps that are either deployed to the cloud or run on-premises. It consists of modular components with minimal overhead, so you retain flexibility while constructing your solutions. You can develop and run your ASP.NET 5 applications cross-platform on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

In this talk, we'll set up our development environment, explore the .NET Version Manager (DNVM), Execution Environment (DNX), and Development Utility (DNU) tools, and create a simple application... all from the command line.
